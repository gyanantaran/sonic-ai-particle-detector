## Introduction
This project aims to accurately determine the number of particles in a container by analyzing the audio signal generated from collisions between the particles and the container walls. To accomplish this, an artificial intelligence (AI) model will be developed that is trained on the audio data to recognize different sound patterns corresponding to different numbers of particles. By using the AI model, we hope to accurately count the number of particles in a container and provide a more efficient and reliable method for particle detection.

## The libraries used
This project uses several Python libraries for audio processing and visualization:

- wave: The wave module is part of Python's standard library and is used to read and write WAV audio files.
- numpy: The numpy library is used for numerical computing and provides efficient array operations for processing audio data.
- pygame: The pygame library is used for creating interactive applications with multimedia capabilities, including audio playback and visualization.

These libraries are used together to simulate a container of particles, generate audio signals from particle collisions, and visualize the container and particle movement using the pygame library. The numpy library is used for processing the audio signals and extracting features, which are then used to train and test the AI model for particle detection.
